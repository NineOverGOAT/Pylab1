Atomic Red Team Plan
1. get ossec talking between security onion and my windows box
  a. For more information about syslog-ng, please see:
https://syslog-ng.org/

syslog-ng listens on port 514 (TCP and UDP) for incoming syslog from other devices (you may need to run so-allow to allow traffic from the IP address of your syslog sender). This gives you basic log collection. If you'd like those logs collected from other devices to be analyzed, another option is to configure OSSEC to receive syslog directly on a port other than the syslog-ng port of 514:

-security onion 192.168.152.128
-windoze  192.168.152.130

2. test the regsrvr32 example
